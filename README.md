# Authentication in Angular with NGRX

## Want to learn how to build this project?
 

 
1. Install dependencies - `npm install`
1. Run the development server - `ng serve`

 

The blog post uses a fake back-end that generates a dummy token to test out the functionality on the front-end. If you'd like to use it, clone down the repo in a new terminal window, install the dependencies, and fire up the app:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nahedkadih/ng10.git
$ npm install
$ ng build
$ ng serve
```

> Just keep in mind that the back-end does **not** create a real JSON Web Token (JWT). Feel free to swap it out for a working back-end or use the final application from the [Token-Based Authentication with Node](http://mherman.org/blog/2016/10/28/token-based-authentication-with-node) blog post, if you'd like.
